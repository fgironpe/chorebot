			<h3>Long time ago in a town not so far, far away...</h3>
			<h4>We could say it isn't so far, because I was born in Madrid...</h4>
			<p>My name is Fernando, I'm 35 years old and I'm a Web Aplications Developer Certificate of Higher Education student.</p>
			<p>For now, I haven't got high education, but because of my age, my career it's almost so long as Star Wars intro because I've been working in a lot of different jobs like waiter, street sweeper, administrative, in a smartphone technical service...</p>
			<p>Since I worked in BQ, I haven't been able to get a proper job and I have been thinking for a while about studying something related to computers, so after my last job contract ends I studied hard to pass the Access Test to a Higher National Certificate, I passed it and I decided to study Web Applications Development.</p>
			<p>I made this game in an online Front End course I studied this summer, and now I've rescued for an English Highschool work.</p>
			<p>In a near future, I hope to pass this course and get a stable and well payed job of Web Developer. I'd like to improve my English for trying to work abroad or even to watch films or play videogames without subtitles.</p>
			<h3>Hobbies</h3>
			<p>I like travel, in these years I've been in different places, in this country and in other foreign countries like Belgium, Cuba, Dominican Republic, France and many others, but the last country that I've visited was England. I stayed 3 days in the south of the island, in Brighton, one of the cities that still have pleasure pier, with restaurants, a casino and an amusement park. The city have a young ambient and doesn't seem too busy like London, where we stayed the other 4 days. What could I say of this grand city.... it was the second time I've been there and I hope travel back in the future because is one of my favourite cities, but the transport and the hotels are too expensive.</p>
			<p>Other hobbies I have is to read, like so many other people in the world... I like history, or historical novels the most, but recently I am reading a Sword and Magic saga called the Final Empire, I like watching films and series too, and playing videogames, but I don't have much time to spend in front of a screen without programming anything for school.</p>
