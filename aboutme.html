			<h3>Long time ago in a town not many far, far away...</h3>
			<h4>We could say it isn't so far, because I was born in Madrid...</h4>
			<p>My name is Fernando, I'm, 35 years old and I'm a Web Aplications Developer Certificate of Higher Education student.</p>
			<p>For now, I haven't got high education, but because of my age, my career it's almost so long as Star Wars intro becasuse I've been working in a lot of different sectors like waiter, street sweeper, administrative, in a smartphone technical service...</p>
			<p>Since I worked in BQ, I haven't been able to get a decent job and I have been thinking in study something computer related for a while, so after my last job contract ends I studied hard to pass the Access Test to a Higher National Certificate, I passed it and I decided to study Web Applications Development.</p>
			<p>I made this game in an online Front End course I studied this summer, and now I've rescued for an English Highschool work.</p>
